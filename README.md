# Deep-Learning-Course-s-Homeworks
This repository contains the codes of the Deep Learning course's homework. This course is given as a master's degree course in IZTECH Computer Engineering Department and is the only master's degree course that I have ever participated in. The last two homework are done by collaborating with Ceyhun Efe Kayan.
